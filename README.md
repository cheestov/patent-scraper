# To-Do

- [ ] set up the collection of more variables for each patent
    - [ ] feasability of collecting pdf or full text of the patent. 
    - [ ] figure out how to parse through there being multiple appointees, what does that mean for the patent?
- [ ] improve reliability of data collection
    - I did not get repeat data points but I am concerned about it skipping data points because it scrolls to far

    * - [ ] CAT next when you get to work is to test what patents are available during each scroll and then you can figure out how far to scroll and collect data  *

- [ ] Find new ways to get past web scraping blockers
    - collecting data from 2019 would take literal years with my current method of getting past web scraping blockers
- [ ] Properly document code. Make it more readable.
- [ ] Set up the program to work on the server and store data there

Optional
- [ ] CLI
